Various improvements for BGO Lobby chat and In-Game Chat

## How to use ##

When typing an emote or someone's name press the `TAB` key to see a list of suggestions, example /con`<TAB>` or @Holl`<TAB>` although you can use any part of the name, so panda`<TAB>` will suggest too.

Once the drop down appears you can either click a suggestion or use the arrow keys and then hit `TAB` again to select an entry.

BONUS FEATURE: While typing if you press the UP key it will go through your previous messages, you can PRESS down to go back down if you overshoot, or to get back to your original message.

BONUS FEATURE 2: Typing /reply will get the username of the last person to @ you.
